# Fake-News-Detection

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset used contains labeled news articles:  
- **Real news** → trusted sources  
- **Fake news** → fabricated/misleading content  

👉 Suggested dataset: (https://www.kaggle.com/code/therealsampat/fake-news-detection) 

## 📈 Model Training & Evaluation  
The notebook covers:  
- Preprocessing raw text data.  
- Vectorizing text with **TF-IDF**.  
- Training multiple ML models.  
- Comparing results with evaluation metrics and visualizations.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python 3**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Numpy, Pandas** – data handling  
- **Scikit-learn** – ML algorithms and evaluation  
- **NLTK / spaCy** – NLP preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – visualizations  

## 📌 Future Improvements  
- Add deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, Transformers like BERT).  
- Deploy as a web application (Flask/Streamlit).  
- Extend dataset for real-time detection from social media feeds.
